This vignette builds on the Raster-vector interactions section of Geocomputation with R (see [geocompr.robinlovelace.net/geometric-operations.html#raster-vector](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/geometric-operations.html#raster-vector)).
It shows the the basics of point pattern analysis in R and how to make (raster) 'heatmaps' from (vector) point data.
It is influenced by the chapter on Spatial Point Pattern Analysis [@bivand_applied_2013] and an [online tutorial](http://rspatial.org/analysis/rst/8-pointpat.html) on Point Pattern Analyis by Robert Hijmans.

We will use the **sp** package for this rather than the newer **sf** package, as point pattern analysis is more established for the former `Spatial` class system than the latter's `sf` classes. We will also use **raster** as it has concise and well-designed functions for spatial data:
