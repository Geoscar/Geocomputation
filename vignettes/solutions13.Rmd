```{r setup, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE, comment = "#>")
```

## Prerequisites {-}

The solutions assume the following packages are attached (other packages will be attached when needed):

```{r packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
library(spData)
```

# Chapter 13

1. We have used `raster::rasterFromXYZ()` to convert a `input_tidy` into a raster brick. Try to achieve the same with the help of the `sp::gridded()` function.
<!--
input = st_as_sf(input, coords = c("x", "y"))
# use the correct projection (see data description)
input = st_set_crs(input, 3035)
# convert into an sp-object
input = as(input, "Spatial")
gridded(input) = TRUE
# convert into a raster stack
input = stack(input)
-->

1. Download the csv file containing inhabitant information for a 100 m cell resolution (https://www.zensus2011.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Pressemitteilung/DemografischeGrunddaten/csv_Bevoelkerung_100m_Gitter.zip?__blob=publicationFile&v=3).
Please note that the unzipped file has a size of 1.23 GB.
To read it into R you can use `readr::read_csv`.
This takes 30 seconds on my machine (16 GB RAM)
`data.table::fread()` might be even faster, and returns an object of class `data.table()`.
Use `as.tibble()` to convert it into a tibble.
Build an inhabitant raster, aggregate it to a cell resolution of 1 km, and compare the difference with the inhabitant raster (`inh`) we have created using class mean values.

1. Suppose our bike shop predominantly sold electric bikes to older people. 
Change the age raster accordingly, repeat the remaining analyses and compare the changes with our original result.
