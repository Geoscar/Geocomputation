The solutions assume the following packages are attached (other packages will be attached when needed):

```{r packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Chapter 2

<!-- vector exercises -->
1. What does the summary of the `geometry` column tell us about the `world` dataset, in terms of:
    - The geometry type?
    - How many countries there are?
    - The coordinate reference system (CRS)?

2. Using **sf**'s `plot()` command, create a map of Nigeria in context, building on the code that creates and plots Asia above (see Figure \@ref(fig:asia) for an example of what this could look like). 
    - Hint: this used the `lwd`, `main` and `col` arguments of `plot()`. 
    - Bonus: make the country boundaries a dotted grey line.
    - Hint: `border` is an additional argument of `plot()` for **sf**  objects.

```{r nigeria, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Map of Nigeria in context illustrating sf's plotting capabilities"}
nigeria = world[world$name_long == "Nigeria", ]
africa = world[world$continent == "Africa", ]
bb_africa = st_bbox(africa)
plot(africa[2], col = "white", lwd = 3, main = "Nigeria in context", border = "lightgrey")
# plot(world, lty = 3, add = TRUE, border = "grey")
plot(world, add = TRUE, border = "grey")
plot(nigeria, col = "yellow", add = TRUE, border = "darkgrey")
ncentre = st_centroid(nigeria)
ncentre_num = st_coordinates(ncentre)
text(x = ncentre_num[1], y = ncentre_num[2], labels = "Nigeria")
```

3. What does the `cex` argument do in the `plot()` function that generates Figure \@ref(fig:contpop)?
    - Why was `cex` passed the `sqrt(world$pop) / 10000` instead of just the population directly?
    - Bonus: what equivalent arguments to `cex` exist in the dedicated vizualisation package **tmap**?
    
4. Re-run the code that 'generated' Figure \@ref(fig:contpop) at the end of \@ref(base-args) and find 3 similarities and 3 differences between the plot produced on your computer and that in the book.
    - What is similar?
        - The map orientation (north is up), colors of the continents and sizes of the circles are the same, among other things.
    - What has changed?
        - The shape of the countries (an equal area projection has been used), the color of the points has changed (to red) and are now filled in (using the `pch` argument to change the point symbol), the plot has graticules and (most subtly) the points are now in the centroid of the largest polygon of each country, rather than in the area-weighted centroid across all polygons per country.
    - Bonus: play around with and research base plotting arguments to make your version of Figure \@ref(fig:contpop) more attractive. Which arguments were most useful.
        - This is a subjective question: have fun!
    - Advanced: try to reproduce the map presented in Figure \@ref(base-args). Copy-and-pasting is prohibited!
        - You can *look* at the code that generated the plot here: https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/blob/master/02-spatial-data.Rmd . If you memorise its important parts, and type them in your own script to reproduce the code that does not count as cheating. That will be a valuable learning experience.

<!-- raster exercises -->
5. Read the `raster/nlcd2011.tif` file from the **spDataLarge** package. 
What kind of information can you get about the properties of this file?
<!-- (crs, ncols, nrow, ncells, bbox, navalues) -->
6. Create an empty `RasterLayer` object called `my_raster` with 10 columns and 10 rows, and resolution of 10 units.
Assign random values between 0 and 10 to the new raster and plot it.
<!-- crs exercises -->
<!-- 1. pros and cons of the projection types -->
<!-- 1. what's the difference between vector and raster transformation -->
<!-- units exercises -->
<!-- 1. ?? -->

3. Exercise 3 <!--missing title-->

- What does the `lwd` argument do in the `plot()` code that generates Figure \@ref(fig:africa). 
- Perform the same operations and map making for another continent of your choice.
- Bonus: Download some global geographic data and add attribute variables assigning them to the continents of the world.
