## What is this talk about?

This talk will introduce *Geocomputation with R*, a new book on R for geographic data.
It will demonstrate how far R has evolved as an environment for geographic data analysis and visualisation, and provide a taster of what is in the book and, more importantly, what is possible when 'data science' and 'GIS' meet.
With new packages such as **sf**, geographic data analysis has become more accessible.
The talk will show how geographic analysis can bring local examples to life.

## Why use geographic data?

- Geographic data is everywhere
- underlies some of society's biggest issues
- Give generalised analyse local meaning

## What is Geocomputation?


.pull-left[

> GeoComputation is about using the various different types of geodata and about developing relevant geo-tools within the overall context of a 'scientific' approach `r Citep(my_bib, "openshaw_geocomputation_2000", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`.

]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("http://www.ccg.leeds.ac.uk/people/s.openshaw/s.openshaw.png")
```
]

--

- But we do differ from early definitions in one important way:

> At the turn of the 21st Century it was unrealistic to expect readers to be able to reproduce code examples, due to barriers preventing access to the necessary hardware, software and data `r Citep(my_bib, "lovelace_geocomputation_2019", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`

---

## Other aspects of the definition

--

> What distinguishes geocomputation from the older quantitative geography, is its emphasis on "creative and experimental" GIS applications `r Citep(my_bib, "longley_geocomputation_1998", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`.

--

It's about doing "practical work that is beneficial or useful" `r Citep(my_bib, "openshaw_geocomputation_2000", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`.

--

> about harnessing the power of modern computers to *do things* with geographic data.

# ecosystem

## Context

- Software for 'data science' is evolving
- **tidyverse** packages **ggplot2** and **dplyr** have become immensely popular
- Shift in public-facing emphasis:
  - Away from implementation (computational efficiency)
  - Towards user friendliness (programmer efficiency)

- Historically spatial R packages have been incompatible with the **tidyverse**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(sp)
dplyr::slice(stplanr::zones, 2) # error
```

```{r slice-eg-sf}
dplyr::slice(stplanr::zones_sf, 2)
```


---

## Viz developments

"The core R engine was not designed specifically for the display and analysis
of maps, and the limited interactive facilities it offers have drawbacks in this
area" `r Citep(my_bib, "bivand_applied_2013", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`.

--

Five years later...

--

"An example showing R's flexibility and evolving geographic capabilities is **leaflet**
`r Citep(my_bib, "R-leaflet", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`,
a package for making interactive maps that has been extended by the R community, as we'll see in Chapter 9" 
`r Citep(my_bib, "lovelace_geocomputation_2018", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`.

---

## A brief history of geographic packages in R

R's predecesor was S, which was itself inspired by lisp `r Citep(my_bib, "chambers_extending_2016", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`.

This is geographic analysis in S `r Citep(my_bib, "rowlingson_splancs_1993", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`:

```
pts <- spoints(scan('cavities'))
uk()
pointmap(pts,add=T) 
zoom()
uk(add=T) 
pointmap(pts,add=T)
poly<-getpoly() 
```

Still works today, 25 years later:

```{r}
library(splancs)
#> Spatial Point Pattern Analysis Code in S-Plus
#> Version 2 - Spatial and Space-Time analysis
```

---

## splancs

```{r, fig.height=4}
# install.packages("splancs"); library(splancs)
# example, interactive! (commented bits)
data(bodmin)
plot(bodmin$poly, asp=1, type="n")
pointmap(as.points(bodmin), add=TRUE)
# zoom()
# pointmap(as.points(bodmin), add=TRUE)
```

---

## Observations
- R' is robust and future-proof 

- See a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Luxllb_WAqY) of Roger Bivand's talk on the subject (live demo of R 0.49) + GitHub [repo](https://github.com/rsbivand/eRum18/blob/master/eRum_keynote_18.Rmd)

- Rs capabilities have evolved substantially since then!

---

## sf

- **sf** is a recently developed package for spatial (vector) data
- Combines the functionality of three previous packages: **sp**, **rgeos** and **rgdal**
- Has many advantages, including:
    - Faster data I/O
    - More geometry types supported
    - Compatibility with the *tidyverse*

---

## sf graphics

```{r}
library(sf)
library(spData)
newcastle_cycling = pct::get_pct_zones("north-east")
plot(newcastle_cycling)
```


---

## Reading and writing spatial data

```{r}
library(sf)
u = paste0("https://github.com/npct/pct-outputs-regional-notR/",
  "raw/master/commute/msoa/north-east/z.geojson")
zones = read_sf(u)
zones = zones[c("geo_name", "all", "bicycle")]
```

- `write_sf()` writes data `st_write(zones, 'zones.gpkg')`.

- See supported formats with: `sf::st_drivers()`. Details: Chapter 6 of our book: [geocompr.robinlovelace.net/read-write.html](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/read-write.html)

---

## sf class 

```{r}
library(spData) # we'll use our own data
class(world)
world
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# ---
## Structure of the sf objects
# world$name_long
# ```
# 
# ```{r, echo=FALSE}
# world$name_long[1:3]
# ```
# 
# ```{r, eval=FALSE}
# world$geom
# ```
# 
# ```{r, echo=FALSE}
# print(world$geom, n = 3)
```


---

## tmap

- A dedicated mapping R package

```{r}
library(tmap)
tm_shape(newcastle_cycling) +
  tm_polygons("bicycle", palette = "RdYlBu")
```

---

## tmap II

- A dedicated mapping R package

```{r}
tmap_mode("view")
tm_shape(newcastle_cycling) +
  tm_polygons("bicycle", palette = "RdYlBu")
```


---

## Summary: recent packages for spatial data

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

The **tidyverse** now (mostly) works with spatial data.

This is thanks to **sf**, a recent package (first release in 2016) that implements the open standard data model *simple features*. Get **sf** with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("sf")
```

Raster data is also supported, in the more mature package **raster**:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("raster")
```


For datasets...:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("spData")
install.packages("rnaturalearth")
```

# osmdata

A package by Mark Padgham and others:

> Padgham, M., Lovelace, R., Salmon, M., Rudis, B., 2017. osmdata. The Journal of Open Source Software 2. https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.00305


```{r}
library(osmdata)
newcastle = getbb("newcastle")
parks = opq(bbox = newcastle) %>% 
  add_osm_feature(key = "leisure", value = "park") %>% 
  osmdata_sf()
parks
```

--

# A map can tell 1000 words

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tmap)
ttm()
qtm(parks$osm_polygons)
```

---

## tidyverse

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

---

## Attribute operations: filtering

```{r, warning=FALSE}
world %>% 
  filter(name_long == "United Kingdom")
```

--

Base R equivalent:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
world[world$name_long == "United Kingdom", ]
```

--

Question:

```{r}
identical(
  world %>% filter(name_long == "United Kingdom"),
  world[world$name_long == "United Kingdom", ]
) # ?
```

---

## Aggregation

```{r}
world_cont = world %>% 
        group_by(continent) %>% 
        summarize(pop_sum = sum(pop, na.rm = TRUE))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
print(world_cont, n = 1)
```


- The `st_set_geometry` function can be used to remove the geometry column:

```{r}
world_df = st_set_geometry(world_cont, NULL)
class(world_df)
```

---

## Spatial operations

It's a big topic which includes:

- Spatial subsetting
- Spatial joining/aggregation
- Topological relations
- Distances
- Spatial geometry modification
- Raster operations (map algebra)

See [Chapter 4](http://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/spatial-operations.html) of *Geocomputation with R* 

---

## Spatial subsetting

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 4}
lnd_buff = lnd[1, ] %>% 
  st_transform(crs = 27700) %>%  # uk CRS
  st_buffer(500000) %>%
  st_transform(crs = 4326)
near_lnd = world[lnd_buff, ]
plot(near_lnd$geom)
```

- What is going with the country miles away?

---

## Multi-objects

Some objects have multiple geometries:

```{r}
st_geometry_type(near_lnd)
```

Which have more than 1?

```{r}
data.frame(near_lnd$name_long,
           sapply(near_lnd$geom, length))
```

---

## Subsetting contiguous polygons

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 6}
near_lnd_new = world %>% 
  st_cast(to = "POLYGON") %>% 
  filter(st_intersects(., lnd_buff, sparse = FALSE))
plot(st_geometry(near_lnd_new))
```

---

## CRS: a key geo* concept

```{r}
na_2163 = world %>%
  filter(continent == "North America") %>% 
  st_transform(2163) #US National Atlas Equal Area
st_crs(na_2163)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
na = world %>%
  filter(continent == "North America") 
png('slides/figs/coord_compare.png', width = 1000, height = 250)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar=c(0,0,0,0))
plot(na[0]);plot(na_2163[0])
dev.off()
```

![](figs/coord_compare.png)

---

## Making maps

- Basic maps of `sf` objects can be quickly created using the `plot()` function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(world[0])
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(world["pop"])
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
png('slides/figs/plot_compare.png', width = 800, height = 300)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar=c(0,0,1,0))
plot(world[0]);plot(world["pop"])
dev.off()
```

![](figs/plot_compare.png)

---

## tmap

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/vignettes/tmap-nutshell.html
```{r, fig.align='center', fig.height=4, message=FALSE}
library(tmap)
tmap_mode("plot") #check the "view"
tm_shape(world, projection = "+proj=moll") +
        tm_polygons("lifeExp", title = "Life expactancy",
          style = "pretty", palette = "RdYlGn") +
        tm_style("grey")
```

---
## leaflet

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
leaflet(world) %>%
        addTiles() %>%
        addPolygons(color = "#444444", weight = 1, fillOpacity = 0.5,
                    fillColor = ~colorQuantile("YlOrRd", lifeExp)(lifeExp),
                    popup = paste(round(world$lifeExp, 2)))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(widgetframe)
library('leaflet')
l = leaflet(world) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addPolygons(color = "#444444", weight = 1, fillOpacity = 0.5, fillColor = ~colorQuantile("YlOrRd", lifeExp)(lifeExp), popup = paste(round(world$lifeExp, 2)))
frameWidget(l, height = '400')
```

---

## Final thoughts

---

## What about raster data?

Raster data in R is evolving:

- **raster** package dominates, designed for `Spatial*` objects, e.g. with `as(my_vector, "Spatial")`


- Efforts to bring raster data closer to the **tidyverse**/**sf** approaches, such as [tabularaster](https://github.com/hypertidy/tabularaster), [sfraster](https://github.com/mdsumner/sfraster) + [fasterize](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/fasterize)
- [stars](https://github.com/r-spatial/stars) focusses on multidimensional space-time (raster/vector) is evolving.
- **[terra](https://github.com/rspatial/terra)** - first release expected 2019

```{r}
raster::plot(spData::elev)
```

## 'Leverage points' where R skills can help

A few examples:

--

- Visualising data: e.g [geoplumber](http://www.geoplumber.com/)

--

- To the public - web viz pkgs help with that!

--

- Local issues. E.g. where's the most dangerous/unpopular road in Newcastle?

--

- Community cohesion

--


Challenge: balance between innovation and tool overload


Challenge: balance between transparency/simplicity and sophistication of analysis


That is a balance R is ideally set-up to strike
